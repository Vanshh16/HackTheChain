    <div class="faq-answer" id="answer2"> We will have mentors available to help you with any technical or
        non-technical issues you may face during the hackathon. You can
        also reach out to the organizers via the Discord server.</div>

    <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(3)"> What happens if I don't have an idea for a project?</div>

        prizes. The other teams would be mentored to help them improve and
        complete their projects.</div>
